# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a mood tracker Progressive Web App (PWA) that allows users to log their daily mood on a 1-5 scale and view their mood history. The app works offline and can be installed on mobile devices.

## Development Commands

This is a vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript PWA with npm for dependency management and development server:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
# or
npm start

# Server runs on http://localhost:3000
```

For deployment:
- **GitHub Pages**: Automatically deploys on push to main branch via GitHub Actions

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Storage**: LocalStorage for mood data persistence
- **PWA Features**: Service worker for offline caching, web app manifest
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (automated via GitHub Actions)

## Key Files
